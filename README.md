# BoPD-screening-initiative
ML model algorithm open source for BI BoPD patient screening project
## introduction
The objective of the borderline personality disorder (BoPD) Automatic Screening Initiative is to advance timely identification of potential BoPD patients. This was made possible by the development of a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm screens electronic health record (EHR) data and automatically identifies patients with highly likely BoPD diagnosis for confirmation of clinical diagnosis.
